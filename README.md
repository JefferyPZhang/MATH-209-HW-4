Due date: Tuesday, December 5th
1. Solve the Laplace equation on the unit square with Dirichlet boundary
conditions in the following cases:
∆upx, yq “ 0, upx, 1q “ fpxq, upx, 0q “ up0, yq “ up1, yq “ 0.
(a) fpxq “ 3 sinp3πxq ´ 2 sin πx.
(b) fpxq “ 1.
2. Solve the Laplace equation on the circle of radius one with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
∆upr, θq “ 0, up1, θq “ fpθq, θ P rπ, πq.
in the following cases:
• fpθq “ 1 ` cospθq ´ sinp2θq.
• fpθq “ 0 if θ P r´π, 0q, fpθq “ 1 if θ P r0, πq.
Suppose now fpθq “ 3θ `2θ
17 ´ psin θq
